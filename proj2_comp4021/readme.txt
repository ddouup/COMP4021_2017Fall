The game can be run both in IE and Firefox. However, there is obvious latency when using Firefox which I dont know why. So please use IE for better experience.

The exit is on the top right. The level of the game is infinite.

Player will get 20 scores for collecting each candy and for killing each monster. And player will get 2 scores for each remaining second of time.
